1. **Predict the Output:**

   Predict the output of the program when the `USE_MYFUNCTION` macro is not defined and when it is defined, assuming the code behaves as follows:

   - When `USE_MYFUNCTION` is **not defined**, the code does not call `myFunction()`, and instead, it executes the code in the `#else` block.
   - When `USE_MYFUNCTION` is **defined**, the code will call `myFunction()` and execute the corresponding code within the `#ifdef USE_MYFUNCTION` block.

   Based on this, the expected outputs can be:

   - **If `USE_MYFUNCTION` is not defined:**
     The program will skip the `myFunction()` call and proceed with the alternative logic provided in the `#else` block. The exact output depends on the contents of this block.

   - **If `USE_MYFUNCTION` is defined:**
     The program will call `myFunction()`, and the output will be determined by the behavior of `myFunction()` itself.

2. **How to Define the USE_MYFUNCTION Macro via Compiler Options:**

   To define the `USE_MYFUNCTION` macro at compile time using compiler options, you can pass the `-D` flag with the macro name when compiling the code. For example, using `g++`:

   ```bash
   g++ -DUSE_MYFUNCTION main.cpp -o main
   ```
